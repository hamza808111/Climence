# SWE496 Requirements Traceability

Status scale:

- `Implemented`: exists in codebase and wired end-to-end.

## Use-Case Coverage

| Use Case | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UC1 Real-Time Map | Partial | Core implemented, some edge flows pending |
| UC2 Historical Trends | Partial | Core charting implemented, richer data controls pending |
| UC3 Forecast | Partial | UI present, production forecasting pipeline pending |
| UC4 Generate Reports | Implemented | Reports modal (topbar + left nav) exports CSV / JSON / print-to-PDF of live snapshot |
| UC-A1 Filter Pollution Data | Partial | Time/pollutant done, location/advanced filtering pending |
| UC-A2 Identify Hotspots | Implemented | Active in API + map rendering |
| UC-A3 Receive Alerts | Implemented | Active threshold-based alerts and feed |

## This Iteration (2026-04-24)

Delivered requirement slice:

- FR-14 / UC-A4: configurable PM2.5 threshold.
- FR-13 / UC-A3 hardening: active alerts now use configurable threshold.
- Snapshot propagation: threshold is now part of live WebSocket snapshot.
- FR-02 / UC-A6: authentication endpoint + dashboard login session.
- FR-03: role model (`administrator`, `analyst`, `viewer`) with permission checks.

## Iteration (2026-04-25)

Delivered requirement slice:

- FR-15 / FR-16 / UC4: report generation and PDF/CSV/JSON export via the Reports modal.
- FR-17 / UC-A5: client-side scheduled report configuration (localStorage).
- FR-11: live forecast computed from `cityTrend` via linear-trend extrapolation + mean reversion.
- FR-12: live source attribution heuristic drives the Sources panel from telemetry instead of static percentages.
- Spec §8 Trend detection: worsening/improving/stable classification is shown as a pill in the City Trend panel.
- NFR-08: Arabic translations for nav, KPIs, side panels, banner, and report modal.
- Design polish: live drift vector in wind compass, trend pill animation, modal micro-interactions, smoother KPI/sources/pollutant transitions.
