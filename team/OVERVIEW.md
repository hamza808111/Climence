# Team Overview — Climence

Five engineers, five vertical slices. Each slice owns a clean set of files and a clear batch of requirements from [docs/SWE496_REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md](../docs/SWE496_REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md). There is overlap at **interfaces** (shared types, the WebSocket snapshot shape) — which is intentional — but **not at file ownership**.

## Ownership matrix

| # | Student | Role | Primary files / folders | Requirements | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Haithem** | Team Lead · Platform & Telemetry Pipeline | [simulator/](../simulator/), [backend/src/index.ts](../backend/src/index.ts), [backend/src/ws.ts](../backend/src/ws.ts), [backend/src/db/](../backend/src/db/), [backend/src/routes/telemetry.ts](../backend/src/routes/telemetry.ts), [shared/src/telemetry.ts](../shared/src/telemetry.ts), [shared/src/messages.ts](../shared/src/messages.ts), [shared/src/constants.ts](../shared/src/constants.ts), [data/](../data/), root tooling | FR-01, FR-04 ingestion, NFR-01, NFR-02, NFR-10 | — (unblocks everyone) |

## Implementation order

Dependencies flow left → right in this diagram. Work in parallel **within a column**.

─────────────────       ───────────────────────             ────────────────

#1 Haithem  ──────▶     #2 Hamza     (auth, alerts)

                        #4 Oussama   (shell, map)   ──▶    cross-cutting:

                                                           polish + accessibility
                                                           across everyone's panels
```

**Start order**

1. **Haithem (Day 1-2)**: lock down the snapshot contract in `shared/src/messages.ts` and any schema changes in `backend/src/db/schema.sql`. Publish a PR so everyone unblocks.
2. **Hamza + Abderraouf + Oussama (Day 3+)**: begin in parallel. Hamza's auth middleware is a prerequisite for Abderraouf's new protected routes — sequence the middleware PR first, then backfill tests.
3. **Imad (Day 4+)**: depends on Oussama's shell scaffold to mount the ReportModal and i18n wiring. Can start the i18n dictionary and report exporters in isolation on Day 3.

## Shared conventions

### Branching

- `main` is protected. No direct commits.
- Feature branches: `<student>/<slice>-<short-desc>`
  - `haithem/platform-snapshot-retention`
  - `hamza/auth-lockout-policy`
  - `abderraouf/analytics-forecast-service`
  - `oussama/frontend-map-drill-down`
  - `imad/reports-excel-exporter`
- One PR per branch. Squash-merge into `main`.

### Commit messages

Conventional Commits, short scope first:

```
feat(backend/auth): add lockout after 5 failed attempts
fix(frontend/map): memo sensor markers so they don't flicker on snapshot
chore(shared): bump AQI band thresholds to EPA 2024
docs(architecture): document WS reconnect backoff
test(backend/alerts): cover threshold boundary at 55.4 ug/m3
```

### Code style

- TypeScript everywhere. `strict: true` is non-negotiable.
- Backend: no SQL in `routes/`, no framework types in `features/`, no Express in `db/`. See the layer table in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Frontend: no cross-panel coupling — lift state to `App.tsx`, pass via props.
- Shared: must stay free of Node-only APIs (runs in the browser).
- Comments: write the **WHY** when non-obvious (incident, invariant, surprising decision). Don't write what the code already says.

### Definition of Done

A task is done when all of the following are true:

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm run test` passes (new logic has at least one unit test)
- [ ] `npm run dev` still boots end-to-end (simulator → API → dashboard)
- [ ] Traceability matrix in [docs/SWE496_REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md](../docs/SWE496_REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md) is updated if status changed
- [ ] New env vars are in the relevant `.env.example`
- [ ] PR description lists user-visible changes and the requirement ID(s)

### Review policy

- Every PR gets at least one review — ideally from the student whose slice is nearest. Cross-slice reviewers watch for:
  - Snapshot shape changes (Haithem reviews)
  - Auth + RBAC changes (Hamza reviews)
  - SQL + query plan changes (Abderraouf reviews)
  - App shell or render path changes (Oussama reviews)
  - Anything touching translations, a11y, or reports (Imad reviews)

### Communication

- Daily 15-min sync (async if remote) — each student says: *yesterday / today / blockers*.
- Design questions → open an issue with `[proposal]` prefix; 24h SLA for written feedback before merging.
- Contract changes to `shared/` require a short heads-up — it breaks everybody.
